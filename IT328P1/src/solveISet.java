/*• Student B will write two methods where one can, if possible, find an assignment that satisfies
a given 3CNF and the other method can find a k-vertex independent set of a given undirected
graph and integer k >= 1. However, Student B doesn’t have to solve the problems directly.
In stead, student B’s methods should polynomially reduce the problems to corresponding
k-clique problems for Student A’s method to solve the k-clique problems and use the finding
to answer the original problems (3CNF or k-vertex independent set). In other words, Student
B should implement two Cook-reductions that reduce 3CNF and Independent-Set problems
to Clique problem.*/
