	a given 3CNF and the other method can find a k-vertex independent set of a given undirected
	graph and integer k >= 1. However, Student B doesn’t have to solve the problems directly.
	In stead, student B’s methods should polynomially reduce the problems to corresponding
	k-clique problems for Student A’s method to solve the k-clique problems and use the finding
	to answer the original problems (3CNF or k-vertex independent set). In other words, Student
	B should implement two Cook-reductions that reduce 3CNF and Independent-Set problems
	to Clique problem.*/
